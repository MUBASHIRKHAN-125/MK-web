                BORED APE YACHT CLUB</h1>
            <p>BAYC is a collection of 10,000 Bored Ape NFTs—unique digital <br>collectibles living on the Ethereum blockchain. Your Bored Ape <br>doubles as your Yacht Club membership card, and grants <br> access to members-only benefits, the first of which is access to<br> THE BATHROOM, a collaborative graffiti board. Future areas <br>and perks can be unlocked by the community through <br> roadmap activation.</p>

        <p> THE SPECS
            <br>
            <br>
        Each Bored Ape is unique and programmatically generated from over 170 <br> possible traits, including expression, headwear, clothing, and more. All apes <br> are dope, but some are rarer than others. <br>
        <br>
            The apes are stored as ERC-721 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain and <br>hosted on IPFS.
            <b>(See Record and Proof.)</b> Purchasing an ape costs 0.08 ETH.
            <br>
            <br>
            To access members-only areas such as <b>THE BATHROOM</b> , Apeholders will <br>need to be signed into their Metamask Wallet.

        <p>When you buy a Bored Ape, you’re not simply buying an avatar or a provably-rare piece <br>of art. You are gaining membership access to a club whose benefits and offerings will <br>increase over time. Your Bored Ape can serve as your digital identity, and open digital <br> doors for you.

        <h1>THE BATHROOM</h1>
        <p>The BAYC Bathroom will become operational once the presale period is over. It <br>contains a canvas accessible only to wallets containing at least one ape. Like <br>any good dive bar bathroom, this is the place to draw, scrawl, or write <br>expletives.
            <br>
            <br>
            Each ape-holder will be able to paint a pixel on the bathroom wall every fifteen <br>minutes. Think of it as a collaborative art experiment for the cryptosphere. A <br>members-only canvas for the discerning minds of crypto twitter.
            <br>
            <br>
            We're pretty sure it's going to be full of dicks</p>
